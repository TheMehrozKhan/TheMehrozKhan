# Contract Sent

Contract Sent is building SaaS Contract Management for scale. After thousands of hours of contract review, we realized the inefficiencies in how many companies manage their SaaS contracts. Contracts are the true source of data in your business, but theyâ€™re not easily accessible. Our goal is to unlock this data to help startups build scalable systems early and fast.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Simple, fast routing engine.
- Powerful dependency injection container.
- Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage.
- Expressive, intuitive database ORM.
- Database agnostic schema migrations.
- Robust background job processing.
- Real-time event broadcasting.

Features
- Signed Contracts: The most reliable source of truth in any business.
- Auditable Data: Contracts provide the most reliable business information.
- Structured Data: Transforming contract data into structured, usable formats.
- Key Data Points Tracking: Focus on contract dates, termination clauses, refund clauses, IP licenses, contract ARR, and SLAs.
